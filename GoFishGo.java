/*
* This will be the game of Go Fish.
*
* Object: The goal is to win the most "books" of cards. A book is any four of a kind, such as four kings, four aces, and so on.
*
* Rules: Four people are playing 1 human and 3 cpu, so each player receives five cards.
* The remainder of the pack is placed face down on the table to form the stock.
*
* The player with the lowest card rank (2) of the lowest suit (alphabetical; clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) plays first.
* The active player will select any opponent and say, for example, "Give me your kings," usually addressing the opponent by name
* and specifying the rank that they want, from ace down to two. The player who is "fishing â€œmust have at least one card of the
* rank that was asked for in their hand. The player who is addressed must hand over all the cards requested.
* If the player has none, they say, "Go fish!" and the player who made the request draws the top card of the stock and places it
* in their hand.
*
* If a player gets one or more cards of the named rank that was asked for, they are entitled to ask the same or another player for a card.
* The player can ask for the same card or a different one. So long as the player succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch),
* their turn continues. When a player makes a catch, they must reveal the card so that the catch is verified.
* If a player gets the fourth card of a book, the player shows all four cards, places them on the table face up in front of everyone,
* and plays again.
*
* If the player goes fishing without "making a catch" (does not receive a card he asked for), the turn passes to the left.
*
* The game ends when all thirteen books have been won. The winner is the player with the most books.
* During the game, if a player is left without cards, they may (when it's their turn to play),
* draw from the stock and then ask for cards of that rank. If there are no cards left in the stock, they are out of the game.
*
* This file will contain the logic necessary to play the Go Fish game with 3 CPU opponents.  You will need to do the following:
* * declare global variables
* * * three (3) CPU players and a human
* * * constant for TOTALBOOKS at 13
* * * integer to hold the scoredbooks
* * * deck based on Deck class
* * * array to hold all the players
* * * integer for selected opponent
* * * String for selected Rank
* * * instantiated variable for first player as "unknown"
* * * and a Scanner object
*
* * main method
* * * ask for the user's name and store it in a variable
* * * loop to allow for play again
* * * * instantiate the deck, set the scoredbooks to zero, instantiate the three cpu players and the human objects
* * * * instante the players array
* * * * ask if they need instructions on how to play, display or not, based on their response
* * * * tell them who they are playing against, call the play game method, and ask if they want to play again
*
* * play game method
* * * deal cards to players, check for book on opening hand, determine first player and announce it
* * * loop to continue the game until total scored books equals TOTALBOOKS (13)
* * * * if acting player does not have a card, they should draw one if there are cards in the deck
* * * * call cpu play method or human play method based on who's turn it is
* * * * cycle players' index from 0 to 3 and back to 0.
*
* * human play method
* * * show the player their hand, ask them to select a rank in their hand, verify their selection, 
* * * and select an opponent, verify their selection in a loop in case of bad inputs
* * * call findMatch method of Player to see if that player has the rank selected
* * * * they either receive go fish and draw a card (if there are cards), or they receive the card from their opponent, and check for book match either way
* * * if they received their selected card, they score a book, and they get to go again
*
* * cpu play method
* * * select a random rank in the hand, select a random opponent, check for match
* * * * they either receive go fish and draw a card (if there are cards), or they receive the card from their opponent, and check for book match either way
* * * if they received their selected card, they score a book, and they get to go again
* 
* * verify rank boolean return method
* * * verifies that the rank selected by player exists in their hand using find match and either makes them select again or returns boolean
* 
* * verify opponent boolean return method
* * * verifies that the opponent selected by player exists using error handling and eithe rmakes them select again or returns boolean
*
* * argument method accepting players array, and selected player to return an integer of the index for selected player
* 
* * argument method accepting players array to determine starting player and returning their name
*
* * display score method
*
* * display hand method
* 
* * display rules method

 * TODO: Fix the time delay
 * Look display each computer's hand each time to see if it is working
 * Check if the scoredBooks variable is updating
 * Check if the findMatch functions are removing the right cards
